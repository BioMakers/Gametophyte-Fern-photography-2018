This is a focus stacking setup based on the Bratcam, built by 
Chris Slaybaw.

Our setup is intended to be a very low-cost system. Apart from 
the optics and the electronics for automation, all of the 
parts are scavenged and cost us nothing. The entire electronic system
was bought for less than £100. Our hope is that this system
can be copied by other research labs who might wish to take deep 
focus brightfield images of their research specimens. If they already 
have access to photographic equipment and old microscopes
then this should be a fairly inexpensive setup to build, and compares 
very favourably with the commercial alternatives, both in cost and 
image quality. 



The focus stacking setup is built using a commercial camera, 
and some electronics, and with a lot of other scavenged parts. 

The rail is automated using an arduino computer,
and this part of the setup is described in the video called 
"automation of the focus stacking rail".

The rail itself is made from a focus block cut from a nikon 
optiphot or labophot microscope. 

The camera is then placed on top of the rail, with the subject 
and lighting positioned accordingly. 

In building the system, we start with the automated rail, with the
automation being described in another video. 

To make the system cheap to build, the
 baseboard is a piece of worktop, and and the focus block
 was cut from an old microscope. This cutting needs special
 equipment but can be carried out in a metalwork shop. 
 The block is 
 cut out using a band saw, and then the screw holes are 
 drilled out
 and the threading added using a tap and die. 
 
 The plastic cogs were bought from an electronics shop, and the centres 
 were cut out using a hacksaw. The cogs were then just pushed on to the 
 stepper motor and the focus block knobs. We haven't found that anything
 further was needed to secure them. 
 
 The base plate for the camers is then attached using a single screw. 
 The plate is just a metal offcut from the metalwork shop, with a hole
 drilled. 
 
 The next step is to add the optics. 
 
 The camera body that we use is a Canon DSLR. Here, a film 
 DSLR body is being used as a stand-in, as our DSLR camera is recording 
 the video footage. 
 
 In our system, we use a Canon 5d MKII DSLR body, an Olympus Zuiko 
 200mm manual focus prime lens, and a Mitutoyo microscope objective
 with a number of adapters in between. However, others have also successfully
 used objectives from the Olympus LMPlanFl range.
 
 First we put on the Olympus OM to Canon EOS adapter. Then the
 200mm prime lens. 
 
 After this we add 2 UV filter rings with the glass removed and then
 the microscope objective adapter. The UV filter rings are needed
 so that the long screw on the microscope objective does not hit the 
 glass of the prime lens before it is fully screwed in. 
 We found this was crucial, because 
 if the objective was not fully screwed in then it sat at an angle and 
 the images were not sharp. 
 
 Lastly the objective itself is added. This is a Mitutoyo plan apo 
 objective, which is optimised for brightfield microscopy.
 
 We then prop up the lens using a piece of pencil eraser so that the 
 long axis of the lens should be exactly parallel to the moving 
 platform. This 
 step needs to be done quite carefully when setting up for photography. 
 
 The next addition is the infra red remote control, which allows 
 the arduino 
 to automatically trigger the camera between movements of the rail. 
 
 Once the optics are all in place, we position the stand that will
 hold the photographic specimen. The diffuser for the lights is a polystrene
 cup, with a piece of black velvet as a photographic background stapled
  inside. 
  
  The flashes are then placed in position, and the remote flash trigger
  is attached to the camera hotshoe. A piece of bluetack
  is added to the photographic support so that the specimen 
  height and angle can be easily adjusted. 
 
 The Arduino is then connected to the computer by a USB cable, and
 the power cord for the stepper motor is plugged in. 
 
 At this point the setup is all ready to go. 
 
 The whole setup, 
 excluding the optics and flashes, cost less then £100 to build, as 
 all but the electronic parts were scavenged. For a research group
  with access to camera equipment, optics and old microscope parts,
  this is a cost-effective way to set up a professional focus stacking
 system. The system is theoretically capable of camera movements 
 down to 1/128th micron, though this may be reduced somewhat by the 
 play in the cogs.
 
 As a final over-view of the system, here is the automation setup,
 which is covered in the detail in another video. 
 
 This is the rail, with the cogs to interface with the stepper motor. 
 
 and this is the optics setup and the 
 specimen support and light diffuser.
