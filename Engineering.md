# Camera trigger

In our previous work we triggered the camera using an <a href="https://github.com/BioMakers/23_Focus-stacking-system-for-gametophyte-ferns/blob/master/ArduinoMethod.md">infra red remote control</a>. In this new project we are planning to convert to an <a href="https://github.com/BioMakers/Gametophyte-Fern-photography-2018/blob/master/CameraTrigger.md"> electrical shutter release wire</a>, fired by the arduino via an audio jack. 

The main gain from this conversion is that we will then be able to use mirror lock-up to reduce vibration. This is not possible using the infra red remote control.
