# Camera trigger

In out previous work we triggered the camera using an infra red remote control. In this new project we are planning to convert to an electrical shutter release wire, fired by the arduino via an audio jack. 

The main gain from this conversion is that we will then be able to use mirror lock-up to reduce vibration. This is not possible using the infra red remote control. 

Here are the parts that we will use to build the new system:
