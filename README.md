Chris works on trap formation in the carnivorous <br>
plant Utricularia gibba, and is interested in the <br>
cellular basis of organ shape. He will provide plant <br>
material for Jennifer to grow and photograph. <br>

Alex works on mutant trichomes in Arabidopsis and <br>
so needs deep focus images of the trichomes at high <br>
magnification. He will provide photographic specimens <br>
for use with the microscope system. <br>



# Summary

Within the 6 month period of the grant, our aim is to design a £100 teaching tool and a curriculum to teach focus stacked photography to secondary school children and undergraduates. <br>

We will also extend our DIY professional-grade system so that it can photograph subjects from 0.25mm to 1cm and beyond. The system’s current range is 0.5mm to 2.5mm (See attached photos). This will enable capture of unique plant science images and will be a valuable teaching tool in its own right. This system will be fully documented so that it can be adapted and copied by other groups. 
Within and beyond the period of the grant, our aim is to use the system to take deep focus images of Arabidopsis trichomes, Utricularia gibba traps, and developing fern gametophytes. <br>

We hope that making these images available will start a trend for sharing of microscopic deep focus plant science images, and provide tools for school and University teaching staff to ignite enthusiasm for these tiny plant specimens. 


# Results

## Videos

Plan for videos:<br><br>

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Alternating movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	The mechanical part of my setup with an ixus camera on top.<br>
3.	The DSLR + objective version of my setup<br>
4.	the automation part with the arduino<br>
5.	perhaps a video of a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>





## printable pdf tutorials 


1.	Principles of focus stacking. Movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	Sheet about a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>
3.	the mechanical part of my setup with details of how to build it and an ixus on top, and hand held remote. <br>
4.	Adaptation to the DSLR still manual but now with microscope objectives.<br> 
5.	the automation part with the arduino.<br>
6.	A page about lighting. <br>
