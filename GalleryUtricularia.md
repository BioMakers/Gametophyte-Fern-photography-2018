These photos are my first attempts with <i>Utricularia gibba</i> traps. 

The are very different from the fern gametophytes that I am used to because they are a floppy pond weed a bit like blanket weed. I can't stand them up on blutac, but instead have to suspend them from tiny crocodile clips. I also have to cut off the side leaves with tiny scissors while they are still under water, otherwise the leaves wrap around the traps.

Christopher Whitewoods has kindly given me this modified version of my photograph showing the areas that he is most interested in. This will really help me to concentrate my efforts in the right place:

These are the first two photos that I have taken. 

This was with the 10x Mitutoyo objective.

This was taken with the new 20x Mitutoyo objective.
