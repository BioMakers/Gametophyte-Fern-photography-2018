## Videos

Plan for videos:<br><br>

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Alternating movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	The mechanical part of my setup with an ixus camera on top.<br>
3.	The DSLR + objective version of my setup<br>
4.	the automation part with the arduino<br>
5.	perhaps a video of a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>

I plan to edit video using Adobe Premiere Pro CS3, which I already have, and have bought a book to learn how to do it. 

Notes:

Chris Slaybaugh's surname is pronounced as in "saw" and "claw".<br>
The powershot SX210 IS does 1080p HD video and so does the Ixus 230 HS. <br>
The DSLR is probably not so good as it might overheat the sensor. <br>
I think 1080p is probably enough. <br>
Most technical videos that I have the patience to watch are under 5 minutes long, and if they don't get my attention in under 16 seconds, I turn them off and try a different one. <br>
http://tv.adobe.com has tutorials on how to use premiere pro. <br>
VLC media player can be used to record what's happening on the computer screen, e.g. Helicon Focus processing. <br>


## printable pdf tutorials 


1.	Principles of focus stacking. Movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	Sheet about a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>
3.	the mechanical part of my setup with details of how to build it and an ixus on top, and hand held remote. <br>
4.	Adaptation to the DSLR still manual but now with microscope objectives.<br> 
5.	the automation part with the arduino.<br>
6.	A page about lighting. <br>

These will be made on Microsoft Word 2003 and converted to pdf using Adobe Acrobat Professional CS3, which I already have.
