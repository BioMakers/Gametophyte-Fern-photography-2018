## Teaching materials for focus stacking

- New domain registered as a front door to all docs: www.chlorophyllosophy.uk

- Leads to a <a href="http://chlorophyllosophyimages.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/focus-stacking-setup.html">central page</a> where all written and video docs can be reached. Also all images. 

- New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9c4s_Co4rjb-4WGpaS0gHQ?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> started as a location for all videos. 

- Four videos already complete. 

- Full video transcripts have been kept so that I can add subtitles when the videos are finalised. 

## Plant imaging

- 5x and 20x lenses have arrived. The 50x lens is on the way. I have decided to use my MP-E lens for 3x to 1x magnifications, which feed up funds to buy the 50x lens. 

- <i>Utricularia gibba</i> plants are growing well and imaging has started. No images good enough to show yet. 

- Wild type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seeds are growing here and mutants are due to be sown soon at Sainsbry Lab. Due to head down to take photos in mid-March. 

- Fern spores sown. The first sowing failed due to fungal contamination.
