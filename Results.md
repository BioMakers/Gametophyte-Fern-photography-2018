## Teaching materials for focus stacking

- New domain registered as a front door to all docs: www.chlorophyllosophy.uk

- Leads to a <a href="http://chlorophyllosophyimages.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/focus-stacking-setup.html">central page</a> where all written and video docs can be reached. Also all images. 

- New <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9c4s_Co4rjb-4WGpaS0gHQ?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> started as a location for all videos. 

- Four videos already complete.

- Full video transcripts have been kept so that I can add subtitles when the videos are finalised. 


### List of videos

Done:
- How does focus stacking work 
- Building the focus stacking setup
- Automation of the focus stacking setup
- Measuring depth of field

For the first video, I have written to SAPS, to my Univ of Glasgow teaching connection and to a local school science teacher to ask if it would be suitable for their students and if they would need any modifications. 


To do:
- Running the code on the focus stacking setup

## £100 teaching tool

My contacts have told me that the £100 tool that I have built is very suitable as a project for an honours student, and that I should try to fully document it so that it could be coppied by someone in this kind of situation. I am working at doing that, with all of the instructions in video format, backed up by my previously written Hackster and GitHub docs. 

I have written to several people who run large secondary school or University classes on this kind of subject, and they have said that they do not have the budget for a £100 teaching tool, or to set up the kind of system that I am thinking of, because of the large numbers of people who have to be taught at once. I have instead made a video that explains the principles of focus stacking, that could be shown to classes, and I have sent that video to my contacts to ask if it would be suitable. 

They said that for teaching material to use useful in school it has to fit with the school curriculum with minimal modification from the teacher, so I'm asking for advice on how my work can fit in. At the moment I think it may fit with GCSE photography and and I am asking SAPS for advice on how it could fit into secondary school plant sciences. 


## Plant imaging

- 5x and 20x lenses have arrived. The 50x lens is on the way. I have decided to use my MP-E lens for 3x to 1x magnifications, which feed up funds to buy the 50x lens. 

- <i>Utricularia gibba</i> plants are growing well and imaging has started. No images good enough to show yet. 

- Wild type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seeds are growing here and mutants are due to be sown soon at Sainsbury Lab. Due to head down to take photos in mid-March. 

- Fern spores sown. 

## Images

We are still working on technical details in getting images of new plants right, and dealing with new lenses that work at different magnifications. However, for my own notes, and others interest, I include some of the practise shots that I have taken in the gallery pages:

- <a href="Gallery.md"> <i>Asplenium scolopendrium</i> (Hart's Tongue Fern)</a>
- <a href="GalleryUtricularia.md"> <i>Utricularia gibba</i> traps (pond weed)</a>
- <a href="GalleryArabidopsis.md"> <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> trichomes</a>
