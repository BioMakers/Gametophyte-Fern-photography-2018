## Videos

Plan for videos:<br><br>

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Alternating movement and photos, and stacking process. <a href="FocusStacking.md">Plan</a><br>
2.	The mechanical part of my setup with an ixus camera on top. <a href="Mechanics.md">Plan</a><br>
3.	The DSLR + objective version of my setup. <a href="DSLRAndObjective.md">Plan</a><br>
4.	the automation part with the arduino. <a href="Automation.md">Plan</a><br>
5.	perhaps a video of a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <a href="MicroscopeMountedCamera.md">Plan</a> <br>

I plan to edit video using Adobe Premiere Pro CS3, which I already have, and have bought a book to learn how to do it. 

Notes:

Chris Slaybaugh's surname is pronounced as in "saw" and "claw".<br>
The powershot SX210 IS does 1080p HD video and so does the Ixus 230 HS. <br>
The DSLR is probably not so good as it might overheat the sensor. <br>
I think 1080p is probably enough. <br>
Most technical videos that I have the patience to watch are under 5 minutes long, and if they don't get my attention in under 16 seconds, I turn them off and try a different one. <br>
http://tv.adobe.com has tutorials on how to use premiere pro. <br>
VLC media player can be used to record what's happening on the computer screen, e.g. Helicon Focus processing. <br>

## printable pdf and word tutorials 


1.	Principles of focus stacking. Movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	Sheet about a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>
3.	the mechanical part of my setup with details of how to build it and an ixus on top, and hand held remote. <br>
4.	Adaptation to the DSLR still manual but now with microscope objectives.<br> 
5.	the automation part with the arduino.<br>
6.	A page about lighting. <br>

These will be made on Microsoft Word 2003 and converted to pdf using Adobe Acrobat Professional CS3, which I already have. 
SAPS ask specifically for Word docs so teachers can adapt them. 

Both school and undergraduate teachers have suggested that the cut up microscope may be too much work for them as they either have no spare microscopes, or need to cater for 100s of students, and don't have 100s of microscopes. I'm wondering if it would be better to make the teaching setup much simpler and have the rail made of lego, with an ixus or smartphone on top. 

I'm also wondering whether it might be good to cover photostacking from a cheap-as-chips teaching microscope with a USB camera on top as some schools may have access to things like that.
