## Videos

Plan for videos:<br><br>

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Alternating movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>
2.	The mechanical part of my setup with an ixus camera on top.<br>
3.	The DSLR + objective version of my setup<br>
4.	the automation part with the arduino<br>
5.	perhaps a video of a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <br>

I plan to edit video using Adobe Premiere Pro CS3, which I already have, and have bought a book to learn how to do it.

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Movement and photos, and stacking process. <br>

3.	the mechanical part of my setup with details of how to build it and an ixus on top, and hand held remote. <br>
4.	Adaptation to the DSLR still manual but now with microscope objectives.<br>
