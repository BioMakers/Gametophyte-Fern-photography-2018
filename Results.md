Plan for videos:<br><br>

1.	Principles of focus stacking. Alternating movement and photos, and stacking process. <a href="FocusStacking.md">Plan</a><br>
2.  The £0 version for schools and first year undergrad. A lego car with a smartphone on top. 
3.	The mechanical part of my setup with an ixus camera on top. <a href="Mechanics.md">Plan</a><br>
4.	The DSLR + objective version of my setup. <a href="DSLRAndObjective.md">Plan</a><br>
5.	the automation part with the arduino. <a href="Automation.md">Plan</a><br>
6. The whole setup working together. 
7.	perhaps a video of a microscope with a camera mounted on top doing the same. <a href="MicroscopeMountedCamera.md">Plan</a> <br>

Notes:

Chris Slaybaugh's surname is pronounced as in "saw" and "claw".<br>

These will be made on Microsoft Word 2003 and converted to pdf. 
SAPS ask specifically for Word docs so teachers can adapt them. 

Both school and undergraduate teachers have suggested that the cut up microscope may be too much work for them as they either have no spare microscopes, or need to cater for 100s of students, and don't have 100s of microscopes. 

Ben Dobson says yes to my idea to make the teaching setup much simpler and have the rail made of lego or books, with an ixus or smartphone on top. 

Everyone is very clear that it has to be curriculum linked and easy for the teachers to find as a curriculum tool, cheap or free, and obviously relevant to their course. 

I have written to the private secondaries to see if they have different priorities. 

I have written to Helicon Focus to ask if they are happy to feature in the videos and to have the students download their demo version. 

Lego wrote back and said it's fine to use lego bricks as long as I am not trying to make money from the work. 

Wrote to Jim Haseloff to ask if he would contribute confocal slices and a 3D to show that focus stacking is used in confocal. 

I phoned Mackays in Cambridge to ask how to cut up a microscope. They said that they would use a bandsaw to cut the microscope. They said that to make threaded holes, then would first drill the hole, and then use a "tap and die" to make the threading in the hole so that it can accommodate a screw in the hole. They said that they can do this work at Mackays, and for people further afield they need to look for a metalwork shop.

## Update - 21/12/2017

I'm editing video using Windows Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere Pro CS3. Photos will be edited with Photoshop CS3. I'm now going to start filming. I'll be using the Canon 5d MKII with the Olympus f/1.8 lens to film. For scenes in which the DSLR body is to appear, I will substitute my Canon film SLR in the scene. 

Batch file format conversions are being done by VLC using the Windows 7 SendTo script on this page:

https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_HowTo/Transcode_multiple_videos/

To find the Send To folder, go to the explorer window and type "SHELL:sendto into the URL bar at the top. Then put this script in a Notepad++ file called MOV_to_MPG_Converter.bat and save as a .bat file. Then the command appears in the Sent To menu item.
