I (Jennifer Deegan) am on a mission to buy myself a new computer screen so I can upgrade to a faster computer, but it is tricky work, because my eyes do not get on with the bright blue light from LED backlit screens (or any other LED light). 

I have been looking into the technical side of this, and reading about lots of other people online who have similar problems, so I thought I would write down my one discoveries here, in case it helps other people. 

So far:

- LED backlit screens are no good.
- CCFL backlit screens bought secondhand are better, but still cause eyestrain and so are not usable (they didn't used to. Not sure why this changed.)
- My Toshiba Satellite Pro U400 CCFL backlit screen is just fine. 
- All of these screen are calibrated using a Spyder3Pro hardware screen colour calibrator, but that doesn't completely solve the probolem.
- Eye specialist says my eyes are fine. 
- Yellow gunnar glasses do not help. 
- Polaroid sunglasses do not help. 

I recently visited Emeritus Professor Arnold Wilkins at his office in the Department of Psychology at the University of Essex. He has studied this problem extensively, and I read his <a hred="https://theconversation.com/the-scientific-reason-you-dont-like-led-bulbs-and-the-simple-way-to-fix-them-81639"> article</a> online.

He explained to me that some people react badly to certain colours of light, and that different people react to different colours. He has designed a machine that shines light of different colours on a white page of printed text. He shows people the page and asks them which colour of light shining on the page makes it most comfortable to read. He can adjust the colour and saturation of the light as they are reading. 

He tested me and found that I experienced eye pain immediately on seeing the particular shade of blue like that is most prevalent in LED light blub light. Fishing around online for a picture of the light spectrum, I find <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkyXG.png"> this image</a> and it is the peak at 450nm that is causing me trouble. 

Conversely, Professor Wilkins found that my eyes were very comfortable looking at the page when it was lit with apricot coloured light. I found this very amusing because my whole house is painted this colour, and I have always been very comfortable reading the Financial Times which is printed on exactly that shade of newspaper.
