I (Jennifer Deegan) am on a mission to buy myself a new computer screen so I can upgrade to a faster computer, but it is tricky work, because my eyes do not get on with the bright blue light from LED backlit screens (or any other LED light). 

I have been looking into the technical side of this, and reading about lots of other people online who have similar problems, so I thought I would write down my one discoveries here, in case it helps other people. 

So far:

- LED backlit screens are no good.
- CCFL backlit screens bought secondhand are better, but still cause eyestrain and so are not usable (they didn't used to. Not sure why this changed.)
- My Toshiba Satellite Pro U400 CCFL backlit screen is just fine. 
- All of these screen are calibrated using a Spyder3Pro hardware screen colour calibrator, but that doesn't completely solve the probolem.
- Eye specialist says my eyes are fine. 
- Yellow gunnar glasses do not help. 
- Polaroid sunglasses do not help. 


Being keen on light though, this has all got me thinking a bit. 

I'm wondering why I can't just use a spyder3pro screen colour calibrator to adjust the spectrum of light coming from the computer screen, so that I don't need to wear the glasses in the first place. I have written to ask them. 

I'm also interested to know if I can use my DSLR camera to measure the spectrum of light coming from the screens that I use, particularly so that I could find out what is so much better about my Toshiba screen than all the others.
