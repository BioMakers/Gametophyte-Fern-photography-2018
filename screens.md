I (Jennifer Deegan) am on a mission to buy myself a new computer screen so I can upgrade to a faster computer, but it is tricky work, because my eyes do not get on with the bright blue light from LED backlit screens (or any other LED light). 

I'm hoping that this will eventually become a self-solving problem, as the display screen industry are working very hard on how to solve it. However, until they do, I just need to find a screen I can use, so I can buy a faster computer, or at least insure myself against my current computer giving up the ghost. 

I have been looking into the technical side of this, and reading about lots of other people online who have similar problems, so I thought I would write down my one discoveries here, in case it helps other people. 

So far:

- LED backlit screens are no good.
- CCFL backlit screens bought secondhand are better, but still cause eyestrain and so are not usable (they didn't used to. Not sure why this changed.)
- My Toshiba Satellite Pro U400 CCFL backlit screen is just fine. 
- All of these screen are calibrated using a Spyder3Pro hardware screen colour calibrator, but that doesn't completely solve the probolem.
- Eye specialist says my eyes are fine. 
- Yellow gunnar glasses do not help. 
- Polaroid sunglasses do not help. 

## Here are the different avenues I am investigating

- <a href="Wilkins.md"> coloured lenses</a>
- <a href="DIYScreen.md"> DIY screen building</a>
- Measuring the spectral output of screens with DSLR or Spyder hardware
- Altering the spectal output of a screen with a spyder3pro
