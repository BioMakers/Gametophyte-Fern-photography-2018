I (Jennifer Deegan) am on a mission to buy myself a new computer screen so I can upgrade to a faster computer, but it is tricky work, because my eyes do not get on with the bright blue light from LED backlit screens (or any other LED light). 

I have been looking into the technical side of this, and reading about lots of other people online who have similar problems, so I thought I would write down my one discoveries here, in case it helps other people. 

So far:

- LED backlit screens are no good.
- CCFL backlit screens bought secondhand are better, but still cause eyestrain and so are not usable (they didn't used to. Not sure why this changed.)
- My Toshiba Satellite Pro U400 CCFL backlit screen is just fine. 
- All of these screen are calibrated using a Spyder3Pro hardware screen colour calibrator, but that doesn't completely solve the probolem.
- Eye specialist says my eyes are fine. 
- Yellow gunnar glasses do not help. 
- Polaroid sunglasses do not help. 

## Here are the different avenues I am investigating

- <a href="Wilkins.md"> coloured lenses</a>
- <a href="DIYScreen.md"> DIY screen building</a>
- Measuring the spectral output of screens with DSLR or Spyder hardware
- Altering the spectal output of a screen with a spyder3pro
