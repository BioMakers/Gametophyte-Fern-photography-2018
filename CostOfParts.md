## Cost of parts to be bought on the grant


I looked into the cost of upgrading software and my computer, but this would have been more than £1300, so I am going to use Microsoft Office 2003 and Adobe Creative Suite CS3, which I already have. <br>

I am planning to use the grant money to buy:<br>

5X M Plan Apo Objective £632 <br>
20X M Plan Apo  £1444 <br>
50x M Plan Apo £1933 <br>
<br><br>
Total: £4009<br>
