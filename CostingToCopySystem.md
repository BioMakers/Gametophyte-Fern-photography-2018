My hope in documenting this system is that an Honours student might be able to copy it for only about £100, if they were able to borrow and scavenge some equipment from various University groups and departments. In this page I will list the parts that will be needed, and which can be borrowed and which probably need to be bought. I will also list the sources and prices of those parts that probably need to be bought, and the places to look for those parts that can probably be found or borrowed. 


# Parts list

## Hardware for the optics

Canon 5d MkII camera body (£1200 several years ago from DigitalRev)<br>
Olympus Zuiko 200mm prime lens (available used only, as it is about 30 years old - about £70 on ebay)<br>
Lens Mount Adapter for Olympus OM Lens to Canon EF-Mount (about £20)<br>
M26X0.706 Mitutoyo microscope female thread to M55mm 55X0.75 adapter micrography (£11.48 on ebay)<br>
Two UV filters (55mm) with the glass removed as an extension to accommodate the long thread of the objective.<br>
10X Mitutoyo Plan Apo Infinity Corrected Long WD Objective (From Mitutoyo: £677.16)<br>
Canon MP-E lens for magnifications under x5.


The focus block, on which the camera rests, is a block from a Nikon Optiphot or Labophot microscope. 

The stepper motor is an RS Pro Hybrid Stepper Motor 0.9°, 44 Ncm, 2.8 V, 1.68 A, 4-wire motor, which was bought from http://uk.rs-online.com/. I intentionally brought quite a beefy motor in the hope that it would be less likely to burn out. It is also very square in the body, which helps to brace it against the board.

Below is a close-up view of the gearing. The gear wheels were bought from http://www.maplin.co.uk/ and then the centres were drilled out or cut out with a hacksaw blade. The plastic gears were very soft, and easy to cut.
