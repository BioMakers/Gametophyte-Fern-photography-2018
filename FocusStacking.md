1) Open on shallow DOF image regular size image, and say "Focus stacking is a technique that turns this..."

2) Fade to deep focus version of same image and say "to this."

3) Explain about slices and the combination of the slices to make the single image. Show several slices and then the composite image. 

4) Show the slices being combined in Helicon Focus. This is a slow section so use an example with only four or five slices. 

5) Talk about the applications of focus stacking - Regular photography, confocal work, and then macrophotography. <br>
Could I find some confocal slices and a composite image perhaps? 

6) Say that this series of videos is about how to set up a cheap DIY focus stacking setup, to teach the principles of focus stacking, and also to show the conversion to a professional setup for macrophotography. 

The End.
